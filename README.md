# Comparitive-Company-Analysis-Automator
This project aims to automate the construction of a CCA model. These models take lots of time to build and require examination of a company's financial statements, among other literature. 
The ultimate goal is to use the EOD Historical API to extract what we can from a company's financials, and dynamically adjust cells to account for what the API cannot return. In so doing,
a decent birds eye view of a company can be obtained in seconds and your time can be spent on actual analysis.
